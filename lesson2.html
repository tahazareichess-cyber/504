<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=fa&text=dismal&op=translate"> dismal</a> place in the back of city <br>that's why this place has too many 
secrets that all people there scared of it.<br> As well as Taha wanted to understand what has<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=fa&text=concealed&op=translate"> concealed</a> there
he wanted to discovered the secrets.<br> Taha ran the way to arrive there then he saw too many dust,<br> so he understood
 no one<a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=fa&text=inhabited&op=translate"> inhabited</a> there since a long time ago.<br>
